        </header>
        <article>
            <h2>Hello, my name is Johnny Marcelino, I am 26 years old and I live in Brazil, São Paulo.</h2>
            <p>I have a degree in electrical engineering and systems analysis and development, I finished both courses in the second half of 2019.</p>
            <p>I started the electrical engineering course in 2015, for reasons of providing greater learning challenges and because of the influence of my brother in the area of ​​engineering, as he has a degree in civil engineering. Thus, during the course, I had the opportunity to enter with a scholarship in the systems analysis and development course, whose choice came from my vocation for technology.</p>
            <p>However, I did not have a concrete opportunity to work in the area and acquire experiences considered important for professional development. Nevertheless, I had an excellent experience working recently in the electrical engineering area at Grupo Jortal&Mac, where I was responsible for managing works in the electrical sector, development of technical reports, improvements and management of dynamic budget spreadsheets, elaboration of electrical projects and budgets of materials for the activities in the works.</p>
            <p>I believe, therefore, that this opportunity will be rewarding and unique for my professional growth, both in the IT and engineering areas, allowing me to unify knowledge and add them in the pursuit of my dreams.</p>
